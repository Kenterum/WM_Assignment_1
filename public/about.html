        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I am Suleyman Mammadov, an intern at SOCAR Downstream, concurrently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology at ADA University. My path has been shaped by diverse experiences across three different countries. Along this voyage, I recently completed a C# Course through Codecademy, honing my skills in C#, SQL, and Microsoft SQL Server. In 2020, I set sail on a significant internship in Hannover, Germany, where I gained valuable hands-on experience in C++, motherboard assembly, and game development. Presently, my internship at SOCAR Downstream continues to be an enriching adventure, providing a dynamic environment for active learning and contribution. Beyond my professional pursuits, I am deeply passionate about community service, a passion that was ignited during my 11th-grade exchange to Germany, an experience that broadened my horizons and nurtured my love for learning and diverse cultures.</p>
