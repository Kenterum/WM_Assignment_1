# Welcome to my repository!

First and foremost, I'd like to mention that I created the "personal card" section in a separate repository. 
- Here is the link to that repository: [Personal_Digital_Card](https://github.com/Kenterum/Personal_Digital_Card)

While writing these codes, some resources helped me. Here's a list of those resources:

- For fonts:
  - <span style="color:blue">[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)</span>
  - <span style="color:green">[Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com)</span>
  
- For patterns:
  - <span style="color:purple">[Css-Doodle](https://css-doodle.com)</span>
  - <span style="color:red">[Haikei](https://app.haikei.app)</span>

Also, thanks to [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), I found the functions I was looking for. 
And with the help of ChatGPT, I organized my codes using the traditional file structure method. In addition, I created the favicon and the avatar with the help of Dall-E 3.
